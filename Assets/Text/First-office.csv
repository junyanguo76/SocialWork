$,0,Mark,r,Hey、thank God you're here! I'm about to lose my mind. As if I don't have enough to deal with already、now the boss wants me to go through some trial review. He says my attitude in handling cases might be a problem. I can’t believe it!,1,,,,,,,
$,1,Mark,r,And don’t even get me started on his new system—scoring us based on how we handle cases. Can you believe that? How are we supposed to work properly with all these regulations breathing down our necks?,2,,,,,,,
$,2,Me,l,Hey、calm down. Tell me more about this trial review.,3,,,,,,,
%,3,,,What is it all about?,4,,,,,,,
$,4,Mark,r,Well—it’s a stupid system. Basically、they score you on things like kindness、intelligence、and compliance. So、like、whether the client likes you、if your decisions are rational、and if you follow the rules. Can you believe it? They want to evaluate our work with such simple numbers、but our work is much more complicated than that! Not to mention there’s no way to make everyone like you!,5,,,,,,,
$,5,Me,l,I think you’re right. It’s impossible to please everyone. Sometimes、all we can do is consider their perspective and be as friendly as possible. Hopefully、they’ll appreciate it in the end.,6,,,,,,,
$,6,Mark,r,Maybe… but it still feels frustrating.,7,,,,,,,
$,7,Me,l,What happens if you don’t pass the review?,8,,,,,,,
$,8,Mark,r,That’s another thing that pisses me off! If your score is too low、you have to go through retraining—or worse、you could even get fired! They claim it’s about accountability and earning the clients’ trust. What a load of nonsense—like anyone actually cares. Though、if your score is high、you apparently get a raise or something. I don’t know.,9,,,,,,,
$,9,Me,l,Relax、as long as you do your job properly、you should be fine.,10,,,,,,,
$,10,Mark,r,Ugh、let’s not talk about this anymore. Oh、did you watch the game last night? It was insane! My God、my friends and I stayed up until 3 AM. That final goal—man、I almost screamed!,11,,,,,,,
$,11,Me,l,I actually didn’t watch it. By the way… you reek of alcohol.,12,,,,,,,
$,12,Mark,r,Oh、come on! You know you can’t watch a game without drinking. Speaking of which、I really need a favor. There’s a family meeting later、and there’s no way I can go like this—I’d get my score slashed to pieces!,13,,,,,,,
$,13,Mark,r,It’s pretty straightforward—a 10-year-old kid. The teacher reported that the child has been acting withdrawn at school lately、barely speaking. We’ve had a few meetings with the family、and eventually、they brought in a family counselor for guidance. The parents are incredibly cooperative—I’ve honestly never seen parents this proactive! If all parents were like this、my job would be a breeze.,14,,,,,,,
$,14,Mark,r,Anyway、it’s just a routine meeting. You don’t have to do much—just sit there and listen. The family therapist I arranged will be there to handle the talking. It shouldn’t take long before the case is wrapped up. Well?,15,,,,,,,
%,15,,,No problem、I got you.,16,,,-1,,,,
%,16,,,This isn’t right—you should go yourself.,17,,,1,,,,
$,17,Mark,r,You’re the best! I knew I could count on you! I’m gonna catch a nap to sober up、or I’m screwed for the meeting with the boss later.,18,,,,,,,
$,18,Mark,r,You have to be kidding me! If I get reported、I’m done for! Come on、just this once—please? I’ll even buy you lunch tomorrow. Deal? Alright、I’m out!,18,,,,,,,
